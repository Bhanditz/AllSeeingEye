To install, simply clone this repo and open the URL chrome://extensions (in Google Chrome) then click on Load Unpacked Extension. Feel free to browse the code so you know what it does and that it's safe.

Will post the link to the Chrome Extension in the Chrome Web Store once it's available so that you may install it directly from the Chrome Web Store rather than manually.
